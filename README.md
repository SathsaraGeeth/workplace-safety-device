## Overview

HyperTronics is a **wearable workplace safety device** designed to improve worker safety in mining environments in Sri Lanka. The device detects:

- Worker falls  
- Hazardous gas exposure  
- Sends real-time SMS alerts with GPS location  

This solution is lightweight, battery-powered, and portable, specifically designed for mining sites in Sri Lanka with limited internet connectivity.



## Problem Statement

Mining remains one of the most hazardous industries in Sri Lanka. Workers are exposed to:

- Falls  
- Toxic gas accumulation  
- Limited communication  
- Delayed emergency response  

Existing solutions are often expensive, non-portable or dependent on internet connectivity.



## Solution

Our wearable device:

- Monitors worker motion and gas levels in real-time  
- Detects falls and hazardous gas exposure  
- Sends instant SMS alerts with GPS location to safety officers  
- Includes a manual tactile switch to cancel false alerts  

This ensures **immediate detection** and **rapid emergency response**.



## System Architecture

### Core Components

| Component | Function |
|-----------|---------|
| STM32F411 Microcontroller | Processes sensor data, controls alerts and GPS/GPRS module |
| MPU-6050 Accelerometer | Detects sudden falls |
| MQ-5 Gas Sensor | Detects hazardous gases such as methane, LPG and butane |
| GPS/GPRS Module | Sends SMS alerts with live location |
| 3.7V 1600mAh LiPo Battery | Power supply with TP4056 charging module |
| TPS61022 Boost Converter | Stable power regulation |
| Buzzer & LED Indicators | Immediate local alert signaling |



### How It Works

1. Sensors continuously monitor motion and gas levels  
2. STM32 processes signals using threshold algorithms  
3. If a fall or hazard is detected:
   - Buzzer and LED activate locally  
   - SMS alert sent with GPS location  
4. User can cancel false alerts with the tactile switch
